# Recommendation System README

## Overview

This project is a Recommendation System designed to suggest items to users based on their preferences and behaviors. The system utilizes various algorithms and techniques to provide accurate and personalized recommendations. The goal is to enhance user experience by suggesting items that are relevant and of interest to them.

## Features

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Uses user-item interactions to recommend items that similar users have liked.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends items similar to those the user has shown interest in, based on item attributes.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines both collaborative and content-based filtering to improve recommendation accuracy.
- **Real-Time Recommendations**: Provides instant suggestions as users interact with the system.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large datasets and provide quick recommendations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Libraries:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
  - TensorFlow (for advanced neural network models)
  - Flask (for the API)
  - SQLAlchemy (for database interaction)
- Database: PostgreSQL or MySQL
- (Optional) Docker for containerization

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/recommendation-system.git
   cd recommendation-system
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Setup the Database:**
   - Create a new database in PostgreSQL or MySQL.
   - Update the `config.py` file with your database credentials.
   - Run the database migrations to set up the necessary tables.
     ```bash
     flask db upgrade
     ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Ensure your dataset is in a suitable format (CSV, JSON, etc.).
   - Use the provided scripts in the `data_preprocessing` folder to clean and prepare your data.

2. **Training the Model:**
   - Run the training script to build the recommendation model.
     ```bash
     python train_model.py
     ```

3. **Starting the API:**
   - Launch the Flask API to serve recommendations.
     ```bash
     flask run
     ```
   - The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

4. **Making Recommendations:**
   - Use the provided endpoints to get recommendations for users.
   - Example endpoint: `http://localhost:5000/recommendations?user_id=123`
